# Quick-Draw

I built this myself as a test of my Swift/SwiftUI skills.

This project was inspired by the War Card Game (Xcode 26) tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq4QKqwNueQ&t=188s). I used the project’s assets, but all the code was written by me as a way to test my current skill set.

I created an observable class to handle the core game functionality, built reusable views, and added subtle animation effects to enhance the overall user experience. I really enjoyed working on this!
